# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- Initial Omarchy Quattro plugin baseline.
- Uses the existing Omarchy bar through a namespaced, optional `bar-widget`.
- Adds a single-process service and panel for overview, launcher, quick settings,
  clipboard history, and a Wayland-native `wtype` keyboard surface.
- Adds an optional multi-monitor dock, touch-sized active-window controls, and a
  notification-center view backed by Omarchy's existing notification service.
- Adds versioned configuration, migrations, diagnostics, rollback, and safe-mode
  CLI flows.
- Deliberately leaves compositor-level wobbly windows and desktop cube disabled
  until a version-pinned Hyprland companion is available.
